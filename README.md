# Population-Management-Databases-Program
This program was made as class project for a C class. It is a simple command line program that allows a user to store multiple datasets for different populations of species that an ecologist might be monitoring. A population is typically all the individuals of one species in an area, but the sample dataset for this projject is just labeled "Frogs," to make it more accesisble for the average user. It allows the user to add, edit and delete population datasets. It also allows the user to add, edit, and delete data points (a population size and a date) from a population dataset. It also gives the user the option to download a dataset as a text file.
